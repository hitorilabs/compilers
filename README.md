1. Front-End:
    - Lexical Analysis (Scanning): Converts the source code into a stream of
      tokens.
    - Syntax Analysis (Parsing): Converts the token stream into an abstract
      syntax tree (AST) or other intermediate representation.
    - Semantic Analysis: Checks for semantic errors and decorates the AST with
      additional information, like types.
    - Efficiency Considerations:
        - Use efficient data structures.
        - Optimize the parser and lexer. Tools like Flex and Bison can help
          generate optimized lexers and parsers.

2. Intermediate Representation (IR):
    - A compiler often translates source code into an intermediate form to make
      optimization easier.
    - The IR should be designed to be easy to transform and analyze.
    - Efficiency Considerations:
        - Choose an IR that captures the necessary information without being
          overly verbose.
        - Use compact in-memory representations.

3. Optimization:
    - The compiler tries to improve the code without changing its meaning.
    - Common optimizations include:
        - Constant folding and propagation.
        - Dead code elimination.
        - Loop optimization.
        - Inlining.
    - Efficiency Considerations:
        - Use data-flow analysis and other techniques to efficiently find
          optimization opportunities.
        - Implement optimization passes that have a high impact on the
          generated code's performance.

4. Back-End (Code Generation):
    - Translates the IR into machine code or another target language.
    - Efficiency Considerations:
        - Use efficient algorithms for register allocation.
        - Implement peephole optimizations to improve the quality of the
          generated code.
        - Target-specific optimizations can greatly improve the performance of
          the generated code.

5. Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT):
    - Some compilers, especially for dynamic languages, use JIT compilation to
      translate code at runtime.
    - Efficiency Considerations:
        - Use techniques like method caching to avoid recompiling code.
        - Implement fast code generation strategies that trade off code quality
          for compilation speed.

6. Parallelism:
    - Modern compilers can use parallel processing to speed up compilation.
    - Parts of the compilation process, especially optimization, can be
      parallelized.

7. Incremental Compilation:
    - Instead of recompiling everything, only recompile the parts of the code
      that have changed.
    - This can greatly speed up the compilation of large projects.

8. Memory Management:
    - Compilers can be memory-intensive, especially for large projects.
    - Efficient memory management can speed up the compilation process.

9. Tools and Libraries:
    - Using well-optimized libraries and tools can help. For instance, using an
      efficient garbage collector can help with memory management.

What makes a compiler "fast" compared to naive implementations:
- Efficient Algorithms: Using the best algorithms for each stage of the
  compilation process.
- Optimized Data Structures: Efficient storage and quick retrieval of
  information.
- Profiling and Benchmarking: Continuously testing the compiler against
  real-world code and optimizing the hot paths.
- Avoiding Redundancy: Eliminating unnecessary work, like avoiding re-parsing
  unchanged code or skipping optimization passes that won't improve the code.
- Tuned for the Target: Implementing optimizations specific to the target
  architecture or platform.
